## DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NODE AND BROWSER 
--- 
Both have different Roles and responsibility so accordingly they have some built in features for them selves . ```  Both are built in with the help of V8 engine , but V8 enginee is powering to differnt tools ``` . Browser is like Chair , steering , etc. part of a car but the Node is a specific run time where there is no steering , no chair , no lights and etc , only a built in V8 enginee and a format through which we can built any kind of Application .

## What is NodeJS (interview)

### âœ… What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime environment** built on Google's **V8 engine** that executes JavaScript code on the server side. It enables JavaScript, traditionally a client-side language, to interact with a machine's operating system, file system, and network, making it suitable for backend development.


### Advantages

The core advantage of Node.js is its **asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model**.

* **Asynchronous I/O:** When Node.js performs a high-latency operation, such as a database query or a file read, it doesn't wait for the response. Instead, it places the operation on an event queue and immediately moves on to process the next task.
* **Event Loop:** A single-threaded **Event Loop** constantly monitors this queue. Once an asynchronous operation completes, its callback function is pushed to a call stack for execution. This mechanism allows Node.js to handle a massive number of concurrent connections efficiently without creating a new thread for each one. This contrasts with traditional server models that use multiple threads, which can consume significant memory and CPU resources.

### Use Cases

Node.js is ideal for building highly scalable applications that handle many concurrent connections, such as:

* **REST APIs & Microservices**
* **Real-time applications** (chat, live updates)
* **Streaming services**

## WHAT IS A SERVER 
--- 

ğŸš€ **A server is a computer or a program that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. Its primary job is to listen for requests from a client, process that request, and send a response back. For a backend developer, a server is the foundation of an application that handles things like storing data, running business logic, and authenticating users.___âœ…(Server is a program , which have certain rules or Task to do )**

## ğŸ’¯ How to built an SERVER with HTTP module . 

```javascript 
const HTTP = require('http');
const Server = HTTP.createServer(); //> Yahan pe Server create ho gaya but abtak chalu nahi hua . 
Server.listen(3000,()=>{
    console.log(`Server is running on localhost:3000`);
})
//> Ab server Listen kar sakta hai client ka request but kuchh response nahi dega because not programmed for it yet . 
//> To start the server we just have to run `node index.js` in the terminal inside class1 directory . 
```
